First post!
Spent a short while setting this site up as a means to record my progress in learning to program.
It should be obvious if anyone is visiting at this point (which I would consider highly unlickely) that all the information and well, everything else, is all just a placeholder. Unfortunatly I have zero expecience with web-development but that's why I'm making this blog in the first place.
My first goal will be to actually make this site mine. To achieve this I will need a basic understanding of html and css.
